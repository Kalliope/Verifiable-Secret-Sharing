	<h1>Simple Power Analysis(SPA) against RSA</h1>

	<p>Simple power analysis (SPA) involves visually interpreting power traces, or graphs of electrical activity over time. <br></p>

	<h2>RSA parameter explanation</h2>

	<img src="rsa_parameter.jpg">

	<p>Ciphertext c(e.g. 5454): demonstrates the encrypted ciphertext by using the secret private key d(e.g. 101).</p>

	<p>P and Q are two copime numbers and the module n = P*Q.</p>

	<p>R = c<sup>d</sup> mod n is the decrypted plaintext. Square and Multiply algorithm is normally used to execute the exponentiation result of c<sup>d</sup>
	mod n. It is an efficient algorithm used for the fast computation of large integer powers of a number. However, it is also vulnerable to Power Analysis.</p>

	<h2>Insecure "Square and Multiply" algorithm explanation</h2>

	<img src="square_and_multiply.jpg">

	<p>"Square and Multiply" algorithm is used to execute the exponentiation of the private key and public key during the encryption and decryption process of
	RSA algorithm.</p>

	<img src="executeprocessofsaq.jpg">

	<p>As shown above, the private key in decimal will first be transformed into binary form.(e.g. 101(dec.) = 1100101(bin.)). After that we calculate the
	exponentiation result according to the current bit from left to right: if the current bit is 1, a multiplication operation (Res = Res*c mod n) will be
	carried out after a squaring operation (Res = Res<sup>2</sup> mod n), otherwise we perform only the squaring operation without following a multiplication
	operation.</p>

	<h2>SPA against RSA demonstration</h2>

	<p>Since the presence of the if statement in the algorithm, "Square and Multiply" is vulnerable to "Power Analysis Attack".</p>

	<img src="visual_of_sam.jpg">

	<p>The power traces between "squaring and multiplication" and "squaring" are different. "Simple Power Analysis" can recover every bit of the secure private
	key d through comparison and analysis of the power traces in each turn. Shown in the figure above, the private key is 1100101.</p>

	<h2>Secure improved "Square and Multiply always" algorithm explanation</h2>

	<p>The original "Square and Multiply" algorithm could be improved through adding a dummy multiplication operation in the branch of bit "0".</p>

	<img src="square_and_multiply_always.jpg"> <img src="processofsama.jpg">

	<p>No matter the current bit is "1" or "0", squaring and multiplication operation will always be carried out. We just according the current bit to choose
	Res_<sub>0</sub> or Res_<sub>1</sub> as the result in next turn.</p>

	<img src="powertraceofsama.jpg">

	<p>Obviously, there are no more distinguished difference between the branches of bit "1" and bit "0", so recovering each bit of private key by comparison the
	power traces using SPA is no more feasible.</p>
