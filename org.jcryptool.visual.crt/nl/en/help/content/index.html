<h1>Chinese Remainder Theorem</h1>

<p>The demonstration is to show the functioning of the <b>Chinese Remainder Theorem</b> plug-in.</p>

The <b>Chinese Remainder Theorem</b> plug-in can be started on the menu visualization and maximize his view.
<p><img src="crt_plugin.jpg" width="755" height="567"></p>

The plug-in consists of two columns. On the left side the description and the computational procedure of the current step is presented and on the right side the input and results of the calculation.
In the<b>Equation group</b> on the right side of the plug-in the parameters of the equation can be entered.

Positive numbers of any size can be used.
By pressing the + button the amount of the equations can be increased and reduced by the - button. The minimum number of equations is two. After determining the number of equations and input parameters the next step can be entered by pressing the
<b>Step 2</b> button.

If the input parameters of the equations was not correct, a dialog box opens where the user can correct the entry.
<p><img src="crt_equationCheck.jpg" width="497" height="385"></p>

The user has the ability to correct themselves or allow the entry by clicking the <b>Suggestion</b> button to propose a valid value from the program. In both cases the user have to log the enter with the <b>Apply</b> button. With the <b>Ok</b> button the user returns to the program and the dialog box closes. The group <b>Step 2</b> is activated and the computational procedure is emphasized.

The user can now switch on by pressing the button <b>Step 3</b> to the third step.  It will appear in the group <b>inverse</b> the intermediate results of the calculations.

The accompanying explanation has been previously described in <b>Step 2</b> group. <b>Step 3</b> describes the calculation of the inverse element.
<p><img src="crt_step3.jpg" width="392" height="94"></p>

The next step is then shown in <b>Step 4</b> in the <b>Inverse</b> group.
<p><img src="crt_inverse2.jpg" width="348" height="197"></p>

The calculation of the final result is described in the last step, <b>Step 4</b>.
<p><img src="crt_step4.jpg" width="391" height="106"></p>

The final result can now be displayed in the group <b>Result</b> by pressing the buttons <b>Result</b>.
<p><img src="crt_result.jpg" width="391" height="140"></p>

For the user to verify the accuracy of the solution all the equations  are shown in the <b>Verify</b> group again.
<p><img src="crt_verify.jpg" width="349" height="144"></p>

The user can display further solutions of the simultaneous congruences by clicking the <b>Next</b> and <b>Previous</b> buttons. The solutions are shown in the <b>Result</b> as well in the <b>Verify</b> group.
To initiate a new calculation, it is enough if you click in the <b>Equation</b> group on the + or - button. It is performed by a reset of the input fields to the <b>Equation</b> group and you can add or remove other equations. This reset is possible from any step.
<p></p>

After passing through the algorithm, it is possible to export calculation. The plug-in supports the output as LaTex, PDF or CSV file.
