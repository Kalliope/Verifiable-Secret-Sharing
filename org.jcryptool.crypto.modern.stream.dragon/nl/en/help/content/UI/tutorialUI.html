<h3>Tutorial for the Dragon cipher</h3>
<p>This tutorial will guide you through an encryption and a decryption with a modern stream cipher,
the Dragon cipher, which is provided by the org.jcryptool.crypto.modern.stream.dragon plug-in.<br>
Note: As with all algorithms, you can only perform the following steps when you have an opened
editor window.<br>
<br><img src="overview.png"><br><br>
Clicking on the Dragon menu item in the Misc sub-menu of the Algorithms menu will bring up the
wizard for the Dragon cipher. This will be applied to the active editor content (unsaved001.txt in the
screenshot above).<br>
<br><img src="figure1.png"><br><br>
Select the size of the key and IV you wish to input; 128 bit or 256 bit. You then have to enter a key
and an IV. The key and IV have to be input in the selected format. In our example, we use 128 bits
as our key/IV size and hexadecimal as the input format for both inputs. Our key has the value of a
128 bit binary number with all one (1) values and our IV has the value of 1 (ie 127 leading zero bits
and a 1 bit). Clicking on the Finish button will start the encryption/ decryption process.<br>

The resulting ciphertext (in output001.bin) can be decrypted, by selecting an identical Key/ IV size
and values in the same wizard that was used for encryption. (Note: The output is opened in a hex
editor rather than a text editor. This is because modern algorithms are based on bytes, not
characters; as such, opening a text editor would be inappropriate.)<br>

Clicking on the Finish button will now start the decryption of the ciphertext and yield the correct
plaintext which will be displayed in a new editor (output002.bin in the screenshot below).<br>

<b>Outputting the keystream</b><br>
Selecting the Display output file with keystream in a separate hex editor radio button will open a
second file containing the generated keystream from that encryption/ decryption process. A
comparison of the keystream from the encryption process to that of the decryption process will
show that given identical inputs, an identical keystream is produced.<br>
<br><img src="figure5.png"><br><br>
The keystream is displayed in a new editor (output004.bin above), with the plaintext being
displayed as usual (output003.bin).
Selecting the Display keystream only (of specified number of bytes): radio button will open a file
containing a specified number of bytes of generated keystream. The number of bytes of keystream
to generate is specified in a textbox which is enabled when the Display keystream only button is
selected.<br>
<br><img src="figure6.png"><br><br>
Our example shows the keystream generated, given the same Key and IV inputs as earlier, up to 100
bytes.</p>
