TranspositionAlgorithmAction_0=Transposition
TranspositionAlgorithmAction_1=Transposition encrypt
TranspositionAlgorithmAction_2=Transposition decrypt
TranspositionAlgorithmCmd_appliesFor1st=\ (applies for the 1st transposition)
TranspositionAlgorithmCmd_appliesFor2nd=\ (applies for the (optional) 2nd transposition)
TranspositionAlgorithmCmd_key2details=Optional second transposition key, which signalizes that a double columnar transposition has to be executed.
TranspositionAlgorithmCmd_noneedfor2ndkeyorders=The specifications of read directions for the second transposition are futile since there will be no second transposition, because no second key is specified.\n
TranspositionAlgorithmCmd_notValidOrderOption=Read direction: did cot recognize one of the valid ('rw', 'cw') options\!
TranspositionAlgorithmCmd_readInOrderDetails=ORDER = 'cw' (column by column) / 'rw' (row by row). Read-in direction of plaintext into transposition table (if not defined,
TranspositionAlgorithmCmd_readOutOrderDetails=ORDER = 'cw' (column by column) / 'rw' (row by row). Read-out direction of transposition table into ciphertext (if not defined,
TranspositionAlgorithmCmd_rowwise_sentence_end=row-wise).
TranspositionAlgorithmCmd_columnwise_sentence_end=column-wise).
