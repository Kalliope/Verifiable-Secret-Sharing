The JCrypTool crypto project contains all crypto plug-ins for JCrypTool: Algorithms (classic and modern), Analysis, Games, Visualizations and XML Security. Basic crypto features are included in this repository too.

This repository requires the plug-ins from the JCrypTool Core repository to compile and to run.
