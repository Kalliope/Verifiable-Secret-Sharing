		<description>Verifiable Secret Sharing is a secret sharing algorithm for sharing a secret. The secret is distributed in a way that every person receives a unique part of the secret. For the reconstruction of the secret are just a few parts necessary. The secret is reconstructed with the Lagrage polynomial. In comparison to Shamir&apos;s Secret Sharing it is possible to verify if all the participants provide a correct part of the secret.</description>
