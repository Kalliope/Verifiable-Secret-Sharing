<h1>Verifiable Secret Sharing</h1>

<p>The <span class="cmbx-10">Verifiable Secret Sharing</span> algorithm has been developed by Paul Feldman in 1987 
and is based on the Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm from Adi Shamir from 1979. With this algorithm it is possible 
to divide a secret into parts and distribute it to multiple persons. For retrieving the secret, just a few of this persons is necessary.
</p>
<p>The <b >Verifiable Secret Sharing</b> plug-in can be started at the menu bar at the point <b>Visualization</b> or at the view
<b >Algorithms</b> in the tab <b >Visualization</b>.</p>

<p><img src="vss_plugin.jpg" width="60%" height="60%"></p>

<p>The plug-in is splitted into 3 parts: The <b>header</b>, the <b>main area</b> itself and further explanations.
<p>The <b>Header</b> shows a short description of the plug-in</p>

<p>The <b>main</b> area contains the boxes to set the parameters and all other computations of the Verifiable Secret Sharing-algorithm.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the screen you can find the area <b>explanations</b> where additional informations for the current step are shown.</p>

<p>Additionally there is a tab <b>Reconstruction Chart</b> where the reconstruction is visualized.</p>

<h3>Setting the parameters</h3>
<p>The parameters, which are necessary for the algorithm, are set in the box <b>Parameters</b>.</p>
<p>At first there will be chosen the number <b>persons n</b>, which are concerned to get a share of the secret.
Furthermore you have to decide about a number <b> persons t</b> how many persons will be needed to reconstruct it.
The number of <b>persons t</b> may not be bigger than <b>persons n</b>. Both numbers have to be at least 2, as far
as <b>Verifiable Secret Sharing</b> doesn't make sense for less involved people than 2.</p>

<p>The next parameter to choose is the <b>secret s</b>. After that, the <b>module p</b>, which have to be a 
safe prime, is calculated automatically. As far as the calculation of safe primes is quite complex, it is 
highly recommended to use the given value. If you don't like to use the proposed safe prime, you still have 
the possibility to enter any other safe prime as long it is at least twice as big than the <b>secret s</b>.
The last parameter is the <b>generator g</b> and is calculated automatically and cannot be changed. 
The <b>generator g</b> will be calculated automatically like <b>p</b>. The <b>generator g</b> is an element of the field Z_p* and has the order <b>q</b>.

<p>If all parameters are set correctly, it is possible to go on to the next step with a click on <b>Determine coefficients</b>.</p>

<h3>Determining the coefficients for the polynomial and calculating the commitments</h3>

<p>The <b>coefficients</b> for the polynomial are set in this box. 
They can be generated by <b>JCrypTool</b> or chosen by yourself. 
The coefficients have to be natural numbers smaller than the <b>module p</b>
The first coefficient is fixed, and is the <b>secret s</b> which already has been chosen.</p>

<p><img src="vss_coefficients.jpg"></p>

<p>In this box you can also find the button <b>Commit</b>. The computation of the commitments is necessary for the verification of the shares afterwards.
The commitments are shown in a seperate box after they are calculated.
</p>

<p><img src="vss_commitments.jpg"></p>

<p>The computation of the commitments is optional, as far as they are just needed to check the shares afterwards. 
They are not needed for the reconstruction of the secret. If you want to do the reconstruction without checking the shares, you don't need the commitments.
</p>

<p>Go on to the next step for calculating the shares with a click on <b>Calculate shares</b></p>

<h3>Checking the shares and reconstruction</h3>

<p>The last step is splitted up in 2 boxes: <b>Shares</b> and <b>Reconstruction</b></p>

<p>The box <b>Shares</b> shows the shares and the shares mod p. For checking the shares, a click on the respective <b>Check</b>-button is necessary. 
Keep in mind that the check won't be succesful if you didn't have done the calculating of the commitments first. To show the sense of checking the shares 
it is possible to change one or more shares. The change of one or more shares has 2 consequences. At first the check for the modified share won't be successful anymore.
And second the reconstruct won't return the primordial secret.
</p>

<p><img src="vss_shares.jpg"></p>

<p>The reconstruction can be done in the box <b>Reconstruction</b>. Before you can start with a click on <b>reconstruct</b> 
it is essential to choose the shares you want to use. It is irrelevant which ones you take as long as equal or more than the minimum.
The minimum is the number of <b>persons t</b> you have chosen in the beginning.</p>
