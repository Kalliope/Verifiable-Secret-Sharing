VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description=Verifiable Secret Sharing is a secret sharing algorithm. The secret is shared in a way,\r\nthat every involved person gets a unique part of the secret. Additionally, every person has the possibility to check if the parts of the other persons are correct.\r\nTo reconstruct the secret, just a certain number, determined in the beginning, of parts of the secret is necessary.\r\nThe secret is reconstructed with the Lagrange-Interpolation.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_parameters_left=In this step the parameters are chosen.\n\r  \u2022 Number of players n [n \u2208 \u2115; n>1] (mandatory item)\n\r  \u2022 Number of players for the reconstruction t [t \u2208 \u2115; 1<t\u2264n] (mandatory item)\n\r  \u2022 Secret s [s \u2208 \u2115] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 Will be set to 2 if nothing is entered.\n\r    \u2012 Is limited by 2.000.000 caused by long processing duration with higher values.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_parameters_right=  \u2022 Module p [p \u2208 \u2119; p > s] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 Will be generated automatically.\n\r    \u2012 It is a prime which is 1 bit longer than s.\n\r  \u2022 g [g \u2208 \u2124_p*; ord(g)  =  q] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 Will be generated automatically.\n\r  \u2022 q [q \u2208 \u2119] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 It is the biggest prime factor of p-1 (p-1 = 2q)

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_coefficients_left=In this step the coefficients for the polynomial P(x) will be set.\n\rThey can be set by the user or randomly generated by the plug-in.\n\ra\u2080 is the secret s. \n\rThe other coefficients a\u1D62 to a_t\u208B\u2081 are set 1 per default. \n\rThe polynomial P(x) is constructed like this: P(x) = a\u2080 + a\u2081x + a\u2082x\u00B2 + ... + a_t\u208B\u2081x^t-1
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_coefficients_right=If all coefficients are set, the polynomial will be displayed\n\rand it is possible to calculate the commitments and shares.\n\rThe calculation of the shares are independent from the calculation of the commitments. \n\rBut keep in mind that the commitments are essential for checking the shares.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_commitments_left=In this step the commitments for each player i are calculated as followed: \n\r y\u2093 = g ^ a\u1D62 mod p \n\rThey are used for the check of the shares.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_commitments_right

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_shares_left=In this step the shares for each player i are calculated like this: \n\rN\u1D62 = P(x\u1D62) mod q \n\rThe value of x\u1D62 is the ID of each player and P(x) is the polynomial. \n\rThe shares are displayed in their origin size and modulo q.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_shares_right=The check of the shares has to be done for each player seperately. \n\rIf the check has been successfull the share becomes green and if not it becomes red. \n\rThe shares modulo p can be falsified to show a how changed share can influence the reconstruction. \n\rThe calculation is done this way:
	
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_reconstruction_left=In this step the reconstruction of the polynomial will be done.\n\rFor reconstructing the polynomial, you have to choose a number of shares which is bigger or at least equal to to. \n\rThe reconstruction is done with the Lagrange polynomial interpolation:
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_reconstruction_right=  \u2022 Keep in mind: \n\r    \u2012 u is the number of chosen shares, \n\r    \u2012 N_k are the shares N\u1D62 and\n\r    \u2012 x_k und x_l are the player IDs. \n\rThe result is the polynomial.\n\rThe coefficient a\u2080 is the secret s.
