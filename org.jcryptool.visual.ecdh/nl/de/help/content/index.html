<h1>Demonstration of Diffie-Hellman key exchange over elliptic curves (ECDH)</h1>

<p>The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communications channel.<br>
The Diffie-Hellman protocol is possible over  mathematical functions, like the multiplicative group of integers mod p or over elliptic curves. Here we use elliptic curves.</p>
<h2>Protocol explanation</h2>
  <h3>Step 1. Establish public parameters</h3>
    <p>Alice and Bob agree on an elliptic curve and a generator <i>G</i> which is a point on the curve.</p>
  <h3>Step 2. Create secret keys</h3>
    <p>Alice an Bob both choose a secret key <i>d</i> which they will keep to themselves.</p>
  <h3>Step 3. Create shared keys</h3>
    <p>Alice and Bob will now multiply <i>G</i> by their own secret keys (scalar multiplication).</p>
  <h3>Step 4. Exchange shared keys</h3>
    <p>Alice and Bob will exchange their shared keys.</p>
  <h3>Step 5. Create session key</h3>
    <p>Alice and Bob will now both multiply each others shared key with their own secret key.<br>
       The session key is the X-value of the calculated key-point.</p>

<h2>Curve demands for cryptography</h2>
  <p>In order to use elliptic curves for (safe) cryptography, the curve needs to meet some demands.<br>
  In the demonstration it's possible to perform the exchange using small elliptic curves. This form is not safe for the actual key exchange because small elliptic curves cannot meet these demands.<br>
  These demands are described in e.g. "SEC 1: Elliptic Curve Cryptography" from Certicom Research (<a href="http://www.secg.org/collateral/sec1_final.pdf">download here</a>).</p>

<h2>The ECDH demonstration</h2>
<p>The demonstration shows how Alice and Bob establish a shared key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol over elliptic curves.<br>
It's possible to perform the protocol with small or large elliptic curves.<br><br>
By pressing each large button in the demonstration, the protocol will proceed to its next step.<br>
It's possible to get a description for each action by selecting the "Show information dialogs" checkbox in the Options panel.<br>

<br><br>
After pressing the button "Set public parameters" it's possible to select an elliptic curve and a generator point <i>G</i>.<br>
<img src="setParameters.PNG"><br><br>
When the parameters are set, they will appear in the "Public parameters" panel.<br>
<img src="parameters.PNG"><br><br>
By selecting each active button, other buttons will become active. When a step is completed the outline of the button will change from red to green.<br>
<img src="greenButton.PNG"><br><br>
When every step is completed, and Alice and Bob successfully created a session key, a key will appear at the bottom of the screen.<br>

To start over, press the "Reset" button in the right corner of the demonstration and all the settings will be erased.<br>
To save the results of the demonstration, select  to where you want to save the results and press "Save".<br>
