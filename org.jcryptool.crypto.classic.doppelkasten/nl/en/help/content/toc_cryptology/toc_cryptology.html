	The Double box cipher, or "Doppelkassetten cipher", was the German answer to the Playfair cipher. The algorithm is basically similar to the Playfair algorithm, but the plaintext is encrypted doubly with two different playfair tables, and splitting of the plaintext was introduced. It was deployed in German communications in 1941-1944 in World War II, and broken in Bletchley Park nearly in the same time span.

	The Double box cipher is based on digraph substitution. Like any cipher that was heavily used in military, many modifications and addition to the basic algorithm.
