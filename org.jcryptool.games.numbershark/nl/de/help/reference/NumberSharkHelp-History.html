<h1>History</h1>

<p>As described in <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[2]</a> and <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[3]</a>
the game was invented by Diane Resek of San Francisco State University in the period of 1971-1973.
She called the game Taxman. In German it is called Number Shark (Zahlenhai
<a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[4]</a>).
The intention of the game was primarily to teach and motivate school children to practice arithmetic.</p>

<p>The rules of the game are described for example in <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[3]</a>.
<br><cite>The player selects a positive integer, let's call it N, and the game then begins with all the integers
from 1 to N being "active". The player can choose any active integer that still has at least one smaller, active integer
that evenly divides into it, and the player's score will then be increased by the number chosen while all smaller,
active divisors of that chosen number are added to the Taxman's score. (All integers that were added to either score are then marked
as inactive.) The player keeps choosing active integers until the only active integers that remain are all relatively
prime to each other. At this point the game ends, with the Taxman's score increased by those unused integers.
The object of the game is for the player to acquire a score larger that the Taxman's.</cite>

<p>I discovered the game during working with CrypTool <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[1]</a>.
That's the reason I called my computer version of the game Number Shark.
My first interest was to find a strategy to win for any number N. Furthermore I was fascinated and interested in the integer sequence
build up by the optimum scores. I am still looking for some pattern or formula behind the numbers. Details of my strategy can
be found in the chapter <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Discussion.html">Discussion of good and optimal strategies for the Number Shark game</a>.
</p>

<p>The CrypTool team implemented a brute force algorithm to find the optimum scores. But the run time of the algorithm is
very time consuming. Dan Hoey <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[2]</a> calculated the optimum scores up to N=102 in 1996
and up to N=158 in 2006. Thanks to him, I could confirm "Schu's random strategy 1&2" algorithms.
I was able to reproduce his findings for N=158 in a reasonable time by my algorithm.
He published also the move sequences to achieve the optimal score for an arbitrary N. Please have a look under the chapter
<a href="NumberSharkHelp-Discussion.html">Discussion of good and optimal strategies for the Number Shark game</a> and <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Appendix.html">"Appendix"</a>
to compare the result of Dan and myself for N=158. I found further move sequences
which differ from Dan's published move sequence.</p>

<p>After implementing "Schu's random strategy 1&2" algorithms, I found the publication of John Trono <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[3]</a>.
He discussed 10 different strategies for the Number Shark game. One of the interesting points was to find some scores
for N=256 and N=512. After implementing his strategy 7, I could unfortunately not reproduce the result.
With my own algorithms I could at least generate a higher score for N=256. His heuristic strategy #3 is implemented in the
Number Shark program as Trono's strategy 3.</p>

<p>In 2009 I found two publications of Robert K. Moniot <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[6]</a>. He discussed
optimal and heuristic strategies in his paper. He gives an estimation about the optimal score, which seems to be in the
range of 75% of the total count. Also he focus on a heuristic strategy to win  always against the Number Shark. He called
his strategy "improved greedy" heuristic. Finally he asked some questions, which could not answered so far.
</p>

<p>I am also interested on answers for these questions. Furthermore I am still interested to find optimal scores larger than N=158. If you find one, please sent to
