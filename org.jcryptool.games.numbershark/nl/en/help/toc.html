<h1>Number Shark</h1>

<p><i>Author: Markus Schu, last edition February 2009</i></p>

<p>The idea behind the game is to win as much as possible numbers from a given number set.
You win, if the sum of your numbers is greater as the sum of the numbers of the Number Shark.
There is a maximum sum for a given number set. Your sum should be as near as possible to the maximum sum.</p>

<p>If you select an arbitrary number, the Number Shark will eat all real divisors of this number.
For example, if you select 6, the Number Shark will eat the numbers 1, 2 and 3.
If some of the divisors has been selected or eaten before, the Number Shark will get only
the rest of the divisors. If there are no divisors any more, the Number Shark will get
the selected number.</p>

<p>The game originally was developed for pupils to learn the behavior of divisors and prime numbers.</p>
