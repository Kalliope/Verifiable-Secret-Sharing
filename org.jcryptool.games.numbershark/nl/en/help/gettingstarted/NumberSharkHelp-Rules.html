<h1>Rules</h1>

<b><u>Goal:</u></b>
<p>You win, if the sum of your numbers is greater than the sum of the Number Shark numbers.
<br>Try to maximise your sum as much as you can.</p></p>

<b><u>Rules:</u></b>
<p>You always have the first turn.

<p>Select an arbitrary number from the number selection area.
The Number Shark eats any real divisors of this selected number, as long these divisors has not yet been eaten up before
(e.g. 6 has the real divisors 1, 2, 3).
Continue selecting of numbers, which have not been selected before or were eaten by the Number Shark in previous rounds.
Pay attention, the Number Shark always needs a number.
If you select a number without remaining free divisors, then the Number Shark will take this number and you will get nothing.
The game is over with the selection of the last free number.</p>

<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>At the beginning, you must decide for a number set.</p>

<p>There are three possible ways to generate the number set (Preferences):</p>

<p>Number set generation mode 1: 1,...,maximum (maximum is the size of the number set).
<br>Number set generation mode 2: minimum,...,maximum (maximum - minimum + 1 is the size of the number set).
<br>Number set generation mode 3: n1, n2, ..., nk (ni is element of IN, 1<=i<=k, k is the size of the number set).</p>

<p>Furthermore you can select out of three support modes (Preferences):</p>

<p>Support mode 1: You play against the Number Shark according to the rules defined above without any support.
<br>Support mode 2: Same as mode 1, but you will get an additional online support.
<br>Support mode 3: Same as mode 1, but you will get a proposal for a solution in advance (button "Strategies+Solutions").</p>

<p>After pushing the button "New Game" you can start the game.</p>
<p>During the game, you can use the button "Undo" to correct only your last selection and
the button "Eat" to accelerate the game by providing with numbers for the Number Shark.</p>

<p><b>By law we must explicitly ask you to read the <a href ="NumberSharkHelp-License.html">license</a> regulations before using the Number Shark.</b></p>
