<h1>Fiat Shamir Protocol</h1>

<p>
<h4>Intention:</h4>
This mathematical protocol is designed to prove to Bob that Alice
knows a secret without revealing it. It runs in the number space
that is build up on the modulo n field, with n being the product of
two prime numbers, p and q. P and q are only known to Alice and must
not be made public.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Appliance:</h4>
Alice chooses an arbitrary number s of the modulo n field with
<span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>gcd(s, n) = 1</code></span> and calculates
<span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>v = s<sup>2</sup> mod n.</code></span>
S will be the secret whereby v is public and used for the proving
process.
<p>

<p>
1)
For the iterations she chooses a randomly generated number r in the
same number space and calculates <span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>x = r<sup>2</sup> mod n.</code></span>
X is sent to Bob.
</p>

<p>
2)
Bob then chooses randomly b which is either 0 or 1 and sends it to
Alice.
</p>

<p>
3)
Alice calculates <span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>y = rs<sup>b</sup> mod n</code></span> and sends y again to Bob.
</p>

<p>
4)
Bob checks if the following equation holds true:
<span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>y<sup>2</sup> mod n = xv<sup>b</sup> mod n</code></span>
</p>

<p>
If the equation holds, one iteration of the protocol is a success.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Vulnerability:</h4>
Carol, the attacker, does not know p, q and s.
She can choose on which x to send to Bob but has no influence on b
which she receives. Therefore we will have two different cases:
</p>

<p>
1) b=0<br>
If b is zero, the equation will express as follows:
<span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>y = rs<sup>b</sup> mod n = rs<sup>0</sup> mod n = r mod n</code></span>.<br>
That would imply if she has chosen a random r to calculate x, she
can now just send this number to Bob to prove her knowledge.
</p>

<p>
2) b=1<br>
If b is one, the equation will express as follows:
<span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>y = rs<sup>b</sup> mod n = rs mod n</code></span><br>
As it is not possible for Carol to calculate s from v, she would
have to construct her x and her y so that it will match the final
check that Bob performs.
This will be accomplished by choosing <span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>x = r<sup>2</sup> * v<sup>-1</sup> mod n</code></span> and
<span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>y = r mod n.</code></span>
If she constructs the numbers like this she will be able to prove
Bob her knowledge for the case b=1.
</p>

<p>
To deceive Bob in both cases Carol would have to construct a special
<span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>x (=r<sup>2</sup> * v<sup>-1</sup>)</code></span>,
 but still must have a number r' which holds<span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>
r'<sup>2</sup> = x.</code></span> This is not possible and therefore she can only cheat Bob
for either the case b=0 or b=1.
</p>

<p>
As Bob chooses b randomly the probability of Carol to guess right by
constructing a matching x is 0.5. By running ten consecutive
iterations we have a chance to deceive Bob of less than 0.1% (0.5<sup>10</sup>),
which should be safe enough for most considerations.
</p>

<p>
By clicking on the "run several times" button in the main interface,
a Fiat Shamir protocol with adjustable iterations can be simulated
from provers and attackers view.
