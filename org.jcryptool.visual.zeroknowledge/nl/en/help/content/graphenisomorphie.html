<h1>Graph Isomorphism</h1>

<p>
<h4>Intention:</h4>
Alice wants to prove to Bob that she knows an isomorphism f from
G_0 to G_1 without revealing f.
</p>

<p>
1)
Alice chooses a random bit a (0 or 1) and creates a new isomorphism g
which results to the graph H when calculating <span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>g(G_[a])</code></span>.
She sends H to Bob.
</p>

<p>
2)
Bob also chooses randomly a bit b (0 or 1) and sends it to Alice. She
should now provide Bob with an isomorphism h which equates to:
<span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>H = h(G_[b])</code></span>.
</p>

<p>
3)
If a = b then the equation <span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>g(G_b) = H = h(G_b)</code></span>
holds true, therefore Alice can just send her before generated isomorphism g to Bob.
</p>

<p>
If a != b then Alice can not simply just send g to Bob because the two
isomorphisms must be different (<span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>g(G_a) = H = g(G_b)</code></span>
can never be true when <span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>G_a != G_b</code></span>).
She is also not able to calculate an isomorphism h which translates
G_b to H because this is a NP problem.
But Alice knows an isomorphism f from G_0 to G_1, therefore she can
apply this to get <span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>f(G_b) = G_a (when a != b)</code></span>.
By using this knowledge she can create the desired isomorphism with
<span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>h(G_b) = H = g(f(G_b))</code></span>.
</p>

<p>
4)
Bob receives h and verifies <span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>H = h(G_b)</code></span>.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Vulnerability:</h4>
Carol, the attacker, does not know the isomorphism f which translates
G_0 to G_1 and vice versa. Therefore she would not be able to provide
Bob with an isomorphism h if a != b holds true (see point 3 in the
protocol flow for calculating h when a != b).
But if a = b then h would be the same isomorphism like g, which she
can create by herself. This concludes that she can successfully answer
Bob's request only if she guessed the same bit like he did.
</p>

<p>
The probability of this, with two valid bit values (0 and 1), is 50%.
By running ten consecutive iterations we have a chance to deceive Bob
of less than 0.1% (0.5<sup>10</sup>), which should be safe enough for most
considerations.
</p>

<p>
By clicking on the "run several times" button in the main interface,
a protocol run with adjustable number of iterations can be simulated
from provers and attackers view.
