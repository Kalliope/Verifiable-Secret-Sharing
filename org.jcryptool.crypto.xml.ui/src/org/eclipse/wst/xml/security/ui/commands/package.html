<p>This package contains all <b>XML Security Tools</b> commands. All commands are implemented
as background jobs. A <i>normal</i> XML document doesn't need that long to sign or encrypt, but it can
take some time until larger documents are completely processed.</p>

<p>Quick command classes contain the commands for the quick functions with access to the preference store. User
interaction is minimized or null for these tasks.</p>
