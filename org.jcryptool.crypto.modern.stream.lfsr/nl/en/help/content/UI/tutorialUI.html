	<h1>LFSR</h1>

	<p>This tutorial will guide you through an encryption and a decryption with a modern stream cipher,
	the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), which is provided by the
	org.jcryptool.crypto.modern.stream.lfsr plug-in.<br>
	<b>Note:</b> As with all algorithms, you can only perform the following steps when you have an opened
	editor window.</p>

	<img src="figure1.png">

	<p>Select the size of the LFSR (restricted to a value between 1 and 25
	for presentation purposes). You then have to select which bits are tapped and the value of the seed
	(the LFSR's initial state). In our example we have an LFSR of length 21. The 5th, 14th, 17th, 18th
	and 21st bits are tapped (note that the final bit is always considered to be tapped). The LFSR's seed
	is 100100100010001000110. Clicking on the Finish button will start the encryption/ decryption
	process.</p>

	<img src="figure2.png">

	<p>The resulting ciphertext (in output001.bin) can be decrypted, by selecting identical settings and
	values in the same wizard that was used for encryption. (Note: The output is opened in a hex editor
	rather than a text editor. This is because modern algorithms are based on bytes, not characters; as
	such, opening a text editor would be inappropriate.)</p>

	<img src="figure3.png">

	<p>Clicking on the Finish button will now start the decryption of the ciphertext and yield the correct
	plaintext which will be displayed in a new editor (output002.bin in the screenshot below).</p>

	<img src="figure4.png">

	<h2>Outputting the keystream</h2>

	<p>Selecting the Display output file with keystream in a separate hex editor radio button will open a
	second file containing the generated keystream from that encryption/ decryption process. A
	comparison of the keystream from the encryption process to that of the decryption process will
	show that given identical inputs, an identical keystream is produced.</p>

	<img src="figure5.png">

	<p>The keystream is displayed in a new editor (output004.bin above), with the plaintext being
	displayed as usual (output003.bin).<br>
	Selecting the Display keystream only (of specified number of bytes): radio button will open a file
	containing a specified number of bytes of generated keystream. The number of bytes of keystream
	to generate is specified in a textbox which is enabled when the Display keystream only button is
	selected.</p>

	<img src="figure6.png">

	<p>Our example shows the keystream generated, given the same seed and tap settings input as earlier,
	up to 100 bytes.</p>
